## Overview

The **IPFS Social Media Ecosystem** is a decentralized, ad-free, non-monetized social media platform built on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). It reimagines social media as a community-driven ecosystem where users create, share, and sustain content by hosting (pinning) what they care about. Designed as a desktop application (with potential web/mobile support), the app serves three core functions:

1. **Pinning Service**: Users run lightweight IPFS nodes to pin content (posts, comments, files) they like, ensuring it remains accessible on the IPFS network. This is the heart of the network’s sustainability, guided by the philosophy: *If you like it, pin it to help host it.*
2. **Pin Organizer**: The app provides a user-friendly interface to browse, manage, and organize pinned content, inspired by app installers like Steam or Linux package managers, making it easy to discover and sustain topics or files.
3. **DAO Validator/Moderator**: Topics can operate as reputation-based Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), where users with earned reputation act as validators or moderators, approving content, voting on rules, or managing community standards—all without tokens or financial incentives.

This ecosystem is **completely free**, with no ads, tokens, or monetary rewards. It relies on community participation and intrinsic motivation to maintain a decentralized, scalable, and resilient platform. A flagship feature is the **WORLD topic**, a global chat room that supports millions of users through dynamic sharding, ensuring scalability without compromising decentralization.

The project leverages **IPFS** for content storage, **IPFS Clusters** for collaborative pinning, **OrbitDB** for decentralized metadata, **IPFS PubSub** for real-time updates, and a **tokenless reputation system** for DAO governance. It’s built for global scale, prioritizing accessibility, privacy, and community ownership.

## Vision and Philosophy

Our vision is to create a social media platform where users have full control over their data and the network’s sustainability. Key principles:
- **Decentralized and Free**: No central servers, no ads, no paywalls—powered entirely by user nodes and voluntary contributions.
- **Community-Driven**: Users pin content they value, keeping it alive on IPFS. Governance (via DAOs) is based on contributions, not wealth.
- **Scalable for the World**: Dynamic sharding and load balancing enable global topics like WORLD to handle millions of users.
- **User Empowerment**: The app combines content creation, pinning management, and DAO governance into a single, intuitive interface.
- **Privacy and Security**: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) ensure secure authentication, and content validation prevents spam without centralized control.

## Features

### Core Features
- **Decentralized Content Storage**: Posts, comments, and files are stored as IPLD (InterPlanetary Linked Data) objects on IPFS, identified by unique Content Identifiers (CIDs).
- **Parent-Child Structure**: Topics (parents) link to comments (children), enabling commenting on any IPFS file (e.g., text, images, videos).
- **Following and Notifications**: Users follow topics or files, receiving real-time updates via IPFS PubSub, with OrbitDB polling as a fallback for reliability.
- **Collaborative Pinning**: Users run IPFS nodes (embedded in the app) and pin content they like, contributing to network availability. IPFS Clusters ensure redundancy across multiple nodes.
- **Pin Organizer Interface**: A Steam-like UI to browse, categorize, and manage pinned content, with tools to set storage limits and monitor pinning contributions.
- **Content Discovery**: Explore categories (e.g., News, Art) or search via decentralized indexes (stored in OrbitDB) to discover trending content based on community engagement (e.g., follows or pins).

### DAO Governance Features
- **DAO Topics**: Topics can function as reputation-based DAOs, where users govern rules, moderate content, or validate posts without tokens or financial stakes.
- **Reputation System**: Earn reputation points through contributions like pinning content (+10 points), validating posts (+5 points), or posting quality content (+5 points). Reputation decays over time to encourage ongoing participation.
- **Validator Role**: Users with sufficient reputation (e.g., >100 points) can act as validators, approving new posts/comments or flagging spam to maintain topic quality.
- **Proposal and Voting System**: Submit and vote on governance proposals (e.g., moderation rules, sub-topic creation) using reputation-weighted votes, stored in OrbitDB.
- **Community Moderation**: Users flag inappropriate content; validators review flags to keep topics clean, ensuring a decentralized approach to content quality.

### Scalability Features
- **Dynamic Sharding**: Automatically splits PubSub topics and OrbitDB instances when they reach capacity (e.g., 10,000 subscribers or 50,000 records), enabling millions of users in topics like WORLD.
- **Cluster Load Balancing**: Distributes pinning across regional IPFS clusters to prevent bottlenecks, with failover to less-loaded clusters.
- **Fallback Polling**: Syncs missed updates via OrbitDB if PubSub becomes unreliable at scale.
- **Pinning Prompts**: Alerts users to pin low-pinned content (e.g., <5 nodes), ensuring availability without mandatory requirements.
- **Global WORLD Topic**: A unified global chat aggregating sharded sub-topics, providing a seamless experience for worldwide discussions.

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Desktop App**: Built with Electron (or React for web), embedding a lightweight IPFS node for non-technical users.
- **One-Click Onboarding**: Simplifies joining the network with an embedded IPFS node and automatic cluster connection.
- **Reputation Dashboard**: Displays user reputation, pinned content, and DAO contributions (e.g., validations, votes).
- **Network Health Metrics**: Shows total pinned content, active nodes, and pin counts to motivate community participation.

## Architecture

The system is fully decentralized, relying on user nodes and community-run infrastructure. Key components:

1. **IPFS Core**:
   - Stores all content (posts, comments, files) as IPLD JSON objects on IPFS.
   - Example Topic IPLD:
     ```json
     {
       "cid": "QmTopic123",
       "title": "WORLD Topic",
       "author": "did:ethr:0x123...",
       "comments": ["QmComment1", "QmComment2"],
       "last_updated": "2025-08-26T18:22:00Z"
     }
     ```

2. **IPFS PubSub**:
   - Handles real-time notifications for followed topics, new posts, DAO proposals, and validations.
   - Sharded topics (e.g., `world-topic/general-1`) to scale beyond 10,000 subscribers per topic.

3. **OrbitDB**:
   - Decentralized database for metadata (e.g., topic details, comment lists, reputation scores, DAO votes).
   - Sharded instances (e.g., `world-topic/general-1`) to handle large datasets, switching at ~50,000 records.

4. **IPFS Clusters**:
   - Enables collaborative pinning across nodes with a minimum replication factor (e.g., 5 nodes per CID).
   - Regional clusters (e.g., Americas, Europe, Asia) for low-latency access, run by community volunteers.

5. **DAO Governance Layer**:
   - Reputation-based system stored in OrbitDB, with no tokens or blockchain.
   - Proposals and votes as IPLD objects; validators (high-reputation users) approve content.
   - Example Proposal IPLD:
     ```json
     {
       "cid": "QmProposal123",
       "content": "Add new moderation rule",
       "author": "did:ethr:0x123...",
       "votes": { "did:ethr:0x456": { "vote": "yes", "weight": 100 } },
       "created_at": "2025-08-26T18:22:00Z"
     }
     ```

6. **Frontend App**:
   - Desktop app (Electron) or web app (React) with an embedded `js-ipfs` node.
   - Features: Browse topics, follow content, manage pins, participate in DAO governance (propose, vote, validate).
   - Aggregates sharded topics into unified views (e.g., WORLD topic feed).

### Scalability Mechanisms
- **Dynamic Sharding**: Splits PubSub topics and OrbitDB instances when capacity is reached (e.g., 10,000 subscribers or 50,000 records), supporting millions of users.
- **Cluster Load Balancing**: Redirects pinning to less-loaded clusters if one is full, ensuring no single point of failure.
- **Fallback Polling**: Uses OrbitDB to sync missed updates if PubSub fails at scale.
- **Pinning Encouragement**: Prompts users to pin content with low pin counts (e.g., <5 nodes) via UI alerts.
- **Reputation-Based Governance**: Scales moderation and validation by distributing tasks to high-reputation users.

### Estimated Capacity
- **PubSub**: 1,000 sharded topics (10,000 subscribers each) can support ~10M users.
- **OrbitDB**: 1,000 sharded databases (50,000 records each) can handle ~50M posts/comments.
- **Pinning**: If 1% of users pin content, a post could be pinned by 10,000 nodes (for 1M users).
- **Global Scale**: With enough shards and volunteer-run clusters, the system could theoretically support 1B users.

## Usage

### Joining the Network
1. Launch the desktop app to initialize an embedded IPFS node.
2. Connect to a public IPFS cluster for collaborative pinning.
3. Create a Decentralized Identifier (DID) for secure authentication.

### Pinning Service and Organizer
1. **Browse Topics**: Explore categories (e.g., News, Art) or the global WORLD topic.
2. **Follow Content**: Subscribe to topics or files to receive updates via PubSub.
3. **Pin Content**: Select posts or files you like to pin them locally or in the cluster, keeping them accessible.
4. **Manage Pins**:
   - Use the app’s organizer dashboard to view and categorize pinned content.
   - Set storage limits (e.g., 1GB) to control resource usage.
   - Monitor pin counts to ensure content availability (target: 5+ nodes per CID).

### DAO Validator/Moderator Role
1. **Enable DAO Mode**: Opt into DAO governance for supported topics (e.g., WORLD).
2. **Earn Reputation**: Pin content, validate posts, or contribute quality comments to gain reputation points.
   - Example: Pinning a post (+10 points), validating a comment (+5 points).
3. **Validate Content**: If reputation exceeds a threshold (e.g., 100 points), approve new posts/comments or flag spam.
4. **Submit Proposals**: Propose topic rules (e.g., moderation policies) or sub-topic creation.
5. **Vote on Proposals**: Use reputation-weighted votes to influence governance decisions.
6. **Monitor Reputation**: View your reputation score and contributions in the app’s DAO dashboard.

### WORLD Topic
- Join the global WORLD topic to participate in a unified chat with millions of users.
- The app aggregates sharded sub-topics (e.g., `world-topic/general-1`) into a single feed.
- Pin posts you like to ensure they stay available.
- Participate in DAO governance to shape the WORLD topic’s rules and moderation.
